<h1>Why I Vote Conservative</h1>

<p>I will be voting for John Major. He is getting better and better
every year. He is very, very good. He now speaks far better than he
did. He's a brilliant speaker.</p>

<p>He is learning to be a real leader. He really does speak out.
Look around and who else is like the old leaders like Winston?</p>

<p>I knew Winston when he was a little boy, He gradually got
stronger and stronger. John Major came to lunch with me when he got
in. He asked me what he should be doing. I said take England back
to what it was.</p>

<p>We really want to be led, and John Major is leading as he has
never before.</p>

<p>I don't want to go in with Europe, and I am hoping the
Conservatives don't join it. Every single bank, telephone and shop
will have to be changed. Why do we want to alter things? It's
appalling and crazy. Who is going to pay? We are. It is the
ordinary person that pays.</p>

<p>What we want is a government who will make England what it
always was when I was young. It was very, very strong. All people
used to copy us abroad. Now no one does. They think we are silly
fools. If we join Europe, we will find ourselves joined to other
countries we have beaten.</p>

<p>The world has moved on, but badly. We need to go back to the
days when everyone wanted to be a gentleman.</p>

<p>Sleaze? What's that? I have never heard of sleaze. My
grandfather probably had affairs but he kept them to himself. Sex
is nobody's business. My books sell all over the world. They don't
sell very well in England because I won't write about sex.</p>

<p>The Labour Party are going to bring in a law that means you can
go everywhere you want in the country. I have checked this with two
people and they both said it was true. People will be able to walk
into your garden and pick your flowers. It is absurd. My garden is
a blaze off flowers. I don't want anyone in there.</p>

<h4>Editor's Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>I really don't want to accuse anyone of becoming forgetful in
their old age, but can I just point out that Winston Churchill was
born in 1874 and Dame Barbara was born in 1901 and therefore the
chances of her knowing him as a little boy are really rather
slim.</li>

<li>This was written in the run-up to the 1997 British General
Election. The Labour Party won this election with a landslide which
allows them to bring in just about any legislation they want, but
we have yet to hear anything of this <i>legalised trespass bill</i>
that Dame Barbara mentions in the last paragraph. Maybe her two
sources were mistaken.</li>

Happy New Year!
<p>A Truly sparkly start to the festive season with the per-Xmas Chill Club
launch party. A good time was had by all and many of you just wouldn't leave.
The only complaint seemed to be that you had to wait until this year to come
again. And look out in February for the return of Flaming June who kicked off
the night brilliantly.</p>
<p>Well, those of you on the mailing list will have your free membership card
(to those of you not in the know it's worth a crisp tenner) so you can get
into the club for just £2.50 until July. However, a word of warning, the club
was 2/3 full by 9:30pm so to be really comfy and grab the best spots try to
get there early.</p>
<p>We've been very choosy about the music (good bands are hard to come by)
and have a great line-up over the coming weeks and months, with those Shy
People resident in January. But remember, we are constantly looking for new
and interesting bands/solo acts etc. so if you happen to see or know any great
talents you think should be playing at the Chill Club get in touch.</p>
<p>We hope to see as many of you as possible over the coming weeks sheltering
from the cold, snuggling up in front of the fire, curled up on a cushion
mellowing out to some great bands. Then we'll all get pissed and dance as late
as we can.</p>
<p>The Chill club opens its doors every Saturday Upstairs at the King's Head
Fulham(entrance thru public bar) and listings can be found in Time Out and
music listings magazines as well as <a href="Chill.html">on this web
site</a>.</p>
<p>See you soon</p>
<p>Chill Out.</p>

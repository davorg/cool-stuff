    <H2>Update [30 Nov 1999]</H2>
    <P>The observant amongst you will notice that this site is no longer
      up to date. I'm sorry to have to admit that I've just not had the
      time that I would have to dedicate to keeping track of all of 
      Labour's misdemeanours.</p>
    <P>In particular I would have liked to write a lot about the London
      Mayoral nominations and how Tony Blair was desparate to keep Ken
      Livingstone from being nominated and how Frank Dobson got some
      very suspicious access to the London Labour Party membership
      records.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I don't have the time to do justice to this project
      any more and therefore it is very unlikely that you will see any
      updates to this site.</p>
    <p>There is one last hope. In the best traditions of Internet and
      Socialist co-operation, I'd be happy to let someone else take the
      site over and give them as much help as I can whilst they get up
      to speed. If you're interested in running this site, then please
      contact me at 
      <a href="mailto:dave@cool-stuff.co.uk">dave@cool-stuff.co.uk</A>.</P>

    <p>Thanks for your interest and support over the last two years.</p>

    <P>As I write it's now six months since the Labour party swept into power 
      with one of the clearest mandates in British political history.</P>
    <P>It was a tremendous result and a very emotionally uplifting night for 
      the millions of socialists in Britain who had suffered eighteen years of 
      repressive Conservative rule.</P>
    <P>Not only did the Labour Party win an outright majority but they won one 
      so large that they are unlikely to have difficulty passing any bills 
      they want. I realise that 'New' Labour does not like to think about 
      itself as a socialist party, but I expected a number of basic human 
      values to be put into law.</P>
    <P>I was wrong.</P>
    <P>Since May 1<SUP>st</SUP> the new Labour government has tried its 
      hardest to be completely indistinguishable from the previous 
      Conservative one.</P>
    <P>This is what LabourWatch is about. It is an attempt by one 'old' Labour 
      supporter to keep a tally on the ways that the 'new' Labour goverment is 
      being a disappointment.</P>
    <P>The two lists below speak for themselves. If anyone has any more pros 
      of cons to add to the lists, or any details to add to ones that already 
      exist please pass them on.</P>
    <P>For balance you might like to look at the 
      <A HREF="http://www.labour.org.uk/">Labour Party web site</A> where you 
      can try to find explanations for this behavior, but you might be a lot 
      better off looking at 
      <A HREF="http://www.labournet.org.uk/">LabourNet</A>.</P>
    <P>At this point of the page there used to be two lists headed 'Things 
      that the Labour government have done which uphold socialist values' and 
      'Things that the Labour government have done which go against socialist 
      values'. I've had to split them off onto a separate page because one of 
      them was geting a bit too long (guess which one!) I've also added a page 
      with a list of more general problems with the political process in the
      UK that the Tories introduced to the UK and the the Labour goverment 
      have done nothing to combat (thanks to Geoff Wexler for giving me the 
      idea for this).</P>
    <P>A couple of other things I've added are the text of a letter that I 
      recently sent to John Prescott in response to another Labour Party 
      begging letter and the text of the <B>real</B> Clause 4 for the 
      nostalgic of heart.</P>

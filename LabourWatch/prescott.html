    <P><EM>Recently my disgust with the Labour party prompted me to write the 
	letter below to John Prescott. As yet I have had no response, but when 
	I do I will post the letter here.</EM></P>
    <P>Rt. Hon. John Prescott MP,<BR>
      Deputy Leader of the Labour Party,<BR>
      John Smith House,<BR>
      150 Walworth Road,<BR>
      London,<BR>
      SE17 1JT </P>
    <P CLASS="right">30 December, 1997</P>
    <P>Dear Mr Prescott,</P>
    <P>I recently received a letter from you that I assume was sent to all 
      members of Sponsorship 2000. It thanked me for my regular financial 
      support before discussing a number of reasons why the Party still needs 
      to raise funds on a regular basis. </P>
    <P>I am, of course, very glad that my contributions were able to help 
      bring down the Conservative government, but I'm sure you must realise 
      that the money from me and thousands of supporters like me was part of 
      a two-way deal. We gave you the money and in return we expected you to 
      build us the society that Britain deserves.</P>
    <P>Now, almost eight months after coming to power, it looks like you have 
      no intention of delivering on your side of the deal. Day after day I 
      read disappointing reports of the Labour government. First it was 
      tuition fees for students then the backtracking on tobacco sponsorship 
      for Formula One. Most recently there is the whole business over cutting 
      benefits to single parents and, possibly, disabled people. These are 
      only the most obvious of your mistakes. I am compiling a full list, 
      which I am making available to the public via the World Wide Web.</P>
    <P>I believe that the size of your majority in the House of Commons is an 
      indication that you seriously misjudged the feeling of the British 
      public. It seems to me that the electorate was so tired of the previous 
      government that you could have won a sizeable victory without throwing 
      out quite so many of our ideals.</P>
    <P>I'm addressing this to you as you are one of the few senior Labour 
      politicians who still seems untainted by Peter Mandelson's influence. 
      I feel sure that no matter what you are forced to say in the interests 
      of Party unity, you can still see that what the government is doing is 
      a direct betrayal of the socialist ideals that so many members have 
      cherished for so long. If there is anything we can do to save the 
      party from the 'New Labour' clones please let me know, as I would love 
      to help.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I will not be following the large numbers of members 
      who seem to leaving the Party in disgust. I have, however, cancelled my 
      regular Sponsorship 2000 payments and will therefore expect to be 
      billed for my membership this year as a regular member. The money that 
      I will save will be sent to Greenpeace.</P>

    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    
    <P>D. M. Cross</P>

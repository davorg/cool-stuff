<h1>Cinefile</h1>

<p><b>What is the first film you saw?</b><br />
It's such a long time ago, I haven't the faintest idea. I've not
been to the cinema for so long because films are not like they used
to be. They are too loud and the music is terrible.</p>

<p><b>What is your favourite film?</b><br />
I liked so many, but I can't remember the titles. I do like films
about animals. especially horses.</p>

<p><b>When is the last time you walked out of the cinema?</b><br />
I never have walked out. but films aren't as good as they used to
be.</p>

<p><b>Most irritating habit in a cinema?</b><br />
People behaving badly. When I went to the cinema men were gentlemen
and had good manners, they wouldn't say anything improper to the
ladies.</p>

<p><b>When was the last time you snogged in a cinema?</b><br />
In London. I was with a man from the Navy, I can't remember his
name. Films were only five shillings in those days.</p>

<p><b>Which actress would you most like to be?</b><br />
Bette Davis, she was very good. She looked presentable and spoke
well.</p>

<p><b>Which actor?</b><br />
I liked James Mason, charrning man. I like actors who play
themselves and are well dressed.</p>

<p><b>When was the last time you cried?</b><br />
I don't like it when people are horrible to each other; there's not
enough happiness in films these days.</p>

<p><b>Who was the most handsome man you ever met?</b><br />
He was a duke. I can't say his name. He'd only been married for two
weeks then fell in love with me and has been ever since.</p>

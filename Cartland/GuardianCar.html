<h1>Me &amp; My Motor</h1>

<p>Now look here: I brought the first white car into London. When
my husband died, his company took away the car that they'd provided
for him and so I had to buy myself one. I went to Rolls-Royce and
said to them: "I want a Rolls-Royce: a white one." They said:
"White! Nobody's ever had a white one." I almost had a row with the
man and told him if he wouldn't do it I'd go to someone who
would.</p>

<p>He said he'd do it and I had the first white car in London.
People used to stop me and try to take a photograph. I'm very
annoyed to hear now that Rolls-Royce - which is very English - has
been bought out. But now it's been taken over by Germans . . .
sorry, foreign people. I think it's awful, quite frankly. What's
the matter with us? Why can't we have our own things? Everything's
been taken over by foreigners and we're not going to have England.
I suppose I'd better not let it be known what car I have at the
moment, because it isn't an English one. I bought one in a hurry.
It's very comfortable: a Mercedes. It's white; I have white cars
you see.</p>

<p>I've got music in it. But I talk, you see, and you can't have
the music and me. I love any music that has a lovely tune. All the
old English tunes you see - you could drive along and then sing
them merrily once you'd got out of your car. All the ones that were
on at the shows. People dressed up so well in those days. When I
was young we danced all night and usually the men took you to a
hotel. That was where all the best dances were. But now Germans own
all the hotels, too.</p>

<p>What's happening to England, the England your fathers knew? It's
awful now - we have all this talk, talk, talk, but we forget that
the great thing was the English gentleman. George IV came in as the
first English gentleman in Europe and after that everybody wanted
to be one. It didn't matter where you were born, but if a man
always said good morning and hello and what have you, people would
say when he died that he was a great gentleman.</p>

<p>We want to get back to the time when a man had beautiful manners
and looked after women and certainly didn't talk about sex all the
time. All our grandmothers would have a fit if people talked about
sex, wouldn't they? My grandfather went around the world three
times in his sailing ship and I'm quite sure he had lots of love
affairs. The point was that he never talked about them. Now people
talk about them even the next morning. I'm shocked, quite
frankly.</p>

<p>Women have learned to drive rather fast. In my day you went
rather slow. I started in the war you see, and I had to drive a
car. All the men were fighting. Women used to drive very, very
carefully because they didn't want to smash their cars up. Nowadays
everybody seems to smash up everything and they don't seem to care
a damn.</p>
